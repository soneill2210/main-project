<h3>WHERE I STARTED</h3><br/>
<p>Back in 2006, after finishing school, I started my apprenticeship in Electrical Engineering through <a class="web-link" href="https://www.src.ac.uk/" target="blank">Southern Regional College</a> in Portadown. The course would allow me to merge study and work in order to progress into the electrical industry. While being in a classroom two days a week, I was required to gain employment for the other three days.
</p>
<br/>
<p>After approaching a few local electricians and larger companies in my area, I managed to get a few interviews. One of the interviews I obtained was for an apprentice Control Panel Builder in a rapidly growing firm,<a class="web-link" href="https://www.axon-online.com" taget="blank"> Axon Power and Control</a>.</p>
<p>This was both an exciting and challenging time as everyday I seemed to be learning new things, but with production moving fast you were expected to pick things up quickly. Within the first six months, I had gone from making up machine-mounted emergency stop boxes to wiring lighting boxes, and eventually to wiring machines that where being sent to quarries and recycling plants all across Europe. I had been taken under the wing of an experienced panel man in order to learn my trade but to also understand electrical schematics. I found this experience invaluable.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>WHERE I AM NOW</h3><br/>
<p>In 2014 I was approached by a local man, Paul Hughes, who was the director of a relatively new company, Elect Automation. He was looking me to assist in wiring control panels in the evenings and weekends. He had secured a deal to be the main electrical supplier for Ezystak Conveyors, who specialized in wheeled and tracked conveyors, screeners and trommel machines to name a few.
    <img class="ezystak text-wrap sm-img"src="C:\Users\mel\Downloads\Screenshot_20210801-130754_Chrome (1).JPG">
 </p>
 <br/>
 <br/>

<p>At the time I started there was only the two of us working but as time went on I was beginning to enjoy this work more and more, and also seen the potential and the heights that Elect Automation could reach, so when the opportunity arose to come on board full time, I grabbed it with both hands.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>As the demand grew, so did the company, and by 2017 I was appointed workshop manager in order to oversee production and by this time I had three young apprentices working under me. I now had to use my experience to train them as well as ensure targets were met.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>In 2018, <a class="web-link" href="https://www.ipowerireland.com/"> Ipower Ireland </a> was born. This is a sister company of Elect Automation which specializes  in the manufacture, sale, modification and hire of diesel and gas generator sets; we exclusively use class-leading components to ensure superior reliability. This new branch of work would open many doors and would allow both companies to expand and grow together.

<p> Throughout these last few years, there has been a major boom in the crushing industry and being able to manufacture both the gen sets and the panels for these machines has served us well. These machines require a much bigger control panel in order to function, mainly due to the size of the motors which are crushing the rock.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<img class="sm-img Rocco" src="C:\Users\mel\OneDrive\Pictures\20210724_082012.JPG" height="500px" width="450px">
<p>The crusher work, at present seems to be the majority of our work and I for one am not complaining. Although the orders are coming in thick and fast and I find myself constantly under pressure I must admit that I do enjoy it. Being in a workshop environment with a good team of individuals makes my job slightly easier. I am well aware of my role as a leader in the workplace and I feel I have taken it in my stride.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>What I enjoy most about my role in Elect Automation is the variety in the work on a daily basis. Although primarily I in the workshop wiring the control panels for these types of machines, more of my roles include maintaining control of stock levels, ensuring the upkeep of health and safety in the workshop and testing our products to ensure the are working to spec and fit for purpose.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>From 2016, since joining Elect Automation, I have also been able to gain a wealth of experience in the on-site installation of machines. This is something I had not been accustomed to working with previous employers and have found it vastly rewarding. Being able to see something we have manufactured and wired out on site, is something I take great pride in. Due to the hard life of crushing, I am now fully equipped to be called onto a site now for a breakdown and use my knowledge and experience in order to solve the problem.

<h3>WHERE I WANT TO BE</h3><br/>
<p>Over the last 15 years, I have come from a novice in the electrical industry to working myself into a managers role in a company with an extremely bright future. I would consider myself extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to work in the places I have worked and also with the good people I have worked with. Although this year, 2021, I have begun to ask myself some serious questions. What can I do to branch out my knowledge and improve myself? What do I see myself doing in ten years? Where do I what to be and how do I get there? Maybe all this self reflection has came from the situation we all find ourselves with Covid 19. Like many other businesses and places of work, we forced to close for 4 weeks at the end of March 2020. I think maybe this time off allowed me the freedom of time that I wouldn't have had before. Around this time I decided to take walk out into the unknown once again.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>From an early age I found myself interest in computers, more specifically on how programmes and software was developed, but I never really pursued that interest, until now. Having doing some extensive research online I decided that the best route for me to take would be to enquire about an online course that I could take up during evenings and weekends, knowing full well that this time off wouldn't be lasting forever. There would soon come a day that factories and businesses would re-open and it would be business as usual. Back to the fast moving world we live in. So I decided to make my move.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<img class="sm-img LP"src="C:\Users\mel\Downloads\seans logo_files\Learning-People.JPG">
<br/>
<p>In May 2021 I reached out to <a class="web-link" href="https://www.learningpeople.com/uk/" target="blank">Learning People</a> to enquire about some of the online courses they offered in web and software development. I was very intrigued to how online study would work as I had never done it before. Having read through some different courses and their content, eventually, I decided on a course onFront End development. This I felt was most suited to me based on what was involved and the realistic time I could set aside to complete it. Immediately after starting the course I knew I had made the correct choice.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>So where does that leave me? What are my goals? Obviously first and foremost, my initial goal is to complete this new line of study to the best of my ability. I believe heading down this route will open many doors for me in the near future. I have given some thought to two very possible options I could get involved in.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>My first option would be to stay in the electrical industry only to move into a role of Programable Logic Controlling (PLC) programming. This involves a program loaded into a PLC system in machine code, a sequence of binary code numbers to represent the program instructions. Although this is not exactly what I am studying at present I believe it will be a create basis to start with. A stepping stone to what I may want to achieve. The way the industry is moving at present is towards more use pf PLC and HMI programming. So rather than having a machine with an normal operated push button function on the door, everything would be operated through a touch screen.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<img class="plc"src="C:\Users\mel\Downloads\seans logo_files\9-plc-programming.JPG">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Another option that would also appeal to me is to step away from electrical altogether by stepping into Web and Software development. This would allow me to step into a role working with websites and web applications that run on internet browsers or alternatively I could move into programming computer software. I must admit that both of these options are of huge interest to me. My intentions at this present moment is to finish my education through Learning People by May 2022, while also giving myself time to decide on how I wish to progress further after. I am well aware of the time and effort that must be put into achieving these goals but I believe myself more than capable of hitting whatever targets I set myself.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p> Right now I consider my education and learning a work in progress but nothing will deter me from what I want to achieve in my professional career as it hasn't done so in the past.
    So... watch this space.
