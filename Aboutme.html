<h3>WHERE IT STARTED</h3><br/>
<p>Back in 2006, after finishing school, I started my apprenticeship in Electrical Engineering through <a class="web-link" href="https://www.src.ac.uk/">Southern Regional College</a> in Portadown. The course would allow me to merge study and work in order to progress into the electrical industry. While being in a classroom two days a week, I was required to gain employment for the other three days.
</p>
<br/>
<p>After approaching a few local electricians and larger companies in my area, I managed to get a few interviews. One of the interviews I obtained was for an apprentice Control Panel Builder in a rapidly growing firm,<a class="web-link" href="https://www.axon-online.com"> Axon Power and Control</a>.</p>
<p>This was both an exciting and challenging time as everyday I seemed to be learning new things, but with production moving fast you were expected to pick things up quickly. Within the first six months, I had gone from making up machine-mounted emergency stop boxes to wiring lighting boxes, and eventually to wiring machines that where being sent to quarries and recycling plants all across Europe. I had been taken under the wing of an experienced panel man in order to learn my trade but to also understand electrical schematics. I found this experience invaluable.</p>

<h3>WHERE I AM NOW</h3><br/>
<p>In 2014 I was approached by a local man, Paul Hughes, who was the director of a relatively new company, Elect Automation. He was looking me to assist in wiring control panels in the evenings and weekends. He had secured a deal to be the main electrical supplier for Ezystak Conveyors, who specialized in wheeled and tracked conveyors, screeners and trommel machines to name a few.

 </p>
 <br/>
 <br/>

<p>At the time I started there was only the two of us working but as time went on I was beginning to enjoy this work more and more, and also seen the potential and the heights that Elect Automation could reach, so when the opportunity arose to come on board full time, I grabbed it with both hands.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>As the demand grew, so did the company, and by 2017 I was appointed workshop manager in order to oversee production and by this time I had three young apprentices working under me. I now had to use my experience to train them as well as ensure targets were met.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>In 2018, <a class="web-link" href="https://www.ipowerireland.com/"> Ipower Ireland </a> was born. This is a sister company of Elect Automation which specialized  in the manufacture, sale, modification and hire of diesel and gas generator sets; we exclusively use class-leading components to ensure superior reliability. This new branch of work would open many doors and would allow both companies to expand and grow together.

<br/>
<p> Throughout these last few years, there has been a major boom in the crushing industry and being able to manufacture both the gen sets and the panels for these machines has served us well. These machines require a much bigger control panel in order to function, mainly due to the size of the motors which are crushing the rock.</p>
