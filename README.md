1.### About the project

I created this project with the intention of learning how to use both HTML and CSS. It is also a way of getting my name out there as I intend to pursue a new career having been involved in the electrical industry for over fifteen years.

2.### Where the project can be located

Whenever my website becomes live there are several places online where it can be viewed from. It will be available to explore in both my
LinkIn profile and also my Github profile.
